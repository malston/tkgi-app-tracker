# TKGI Application Tracker - Migration Readiness Guide

## Overview

The TKGI Application Tracker's **Migration Readiness Statistics** provide a comprehensive, data-driven approach to assess how prepared applications are for migration from TKGI (Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated) to other platforms such as OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). This system transforms raw operational data into actionable business intelligence for migration planning.

## Core Migration Readiness Score (0-100)

### Scoring Algorithm

Each application receives a numerical score calculated using a sophisticated algorithm that starts with a perfect score and deducts points based on complexity and risk factors.

#### **Base Score: 100 Points**

Every application begins with a perfect migration readiness score of 100 points.

#### **Deduction Factors**

The system applies the following deductions based on application characteristics:

| Factor | Deduction | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Active Application** | -30 points | Currently running applications require coordination, planning, and potential downtime management |
| **Large Applications (>10 pods)** | -20 points | High complexity due to multiple components, dependencies, and resource requirements |
| **Medium Applications (5-10 pods)** | -10 points | Moderate complexity requiring careful resource planning |
| **Production Environment** | -20 points | Production applications require rigorous testing, rollback plans, and careful migration timing |
| **Complex Networking (>5 services)** | -10 points | Multiple services indicate complex networking requirements and potential ingress/egress challenges |
| **Poor Data Quality** | -15 points | Missing or incomplete metadata requires investigation and documentation before migration |

#### **Bonus Point Opportunities**

Applications can receive bonus points that improve their migration readiness:

| Factor | Bonus | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Long-term Inactive (>60 days)** | +20 points | Likely abandoned applications with minimal business impact |
| **Recently Inactive (30-60 days)** | +10 points | Applications with reduced operational risk |

#### **Score Calculation Example**

```python
def calculate_migration_readiness(app):
    score = 100

    # Deductions
    if app.is_active:
        score -= 30
    if app.pod_count > 10:
        score -= 20
    elif app.pod_count > 5:
        score -= 10
    if app.environment == 'production':
        score -= 20
    if app.service_count > 5:
        score -= 10
    if app.data_quality == 'incomplete':
        score -= 15

    # Bonuses
    if app.days_inactive > 60:
        score += 20
    elif app.days_inactive > 30:
        score += 10

    return max(0, min(100, score))
```

## Score Interpretation Framework

### Migration Readiness Categories

| Score Range | Classification | Status | Characteristics | Recommended Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **80-100** | **Ready** | Immediate migration candidate | Inactive, small, non-production, or well-documented applications | Schedule migration within 2-4 weeks |
| **60-79** | **Planning** | Minor planning needed | Active applications with moderate complexity or good documentation | Plan migration within 4-8 weeks |
| **40-59** | **Complex** | Significant planning required | Production apps, medium complexity, or some missing metadata | Detailed analysis needed, 8-16 week timeline |
| **0-39** | **High Risk** | Complex migration requiring extensive analysis | Large, active, production applications with complex networking | Comprehensive study, 16+ week timeline |
